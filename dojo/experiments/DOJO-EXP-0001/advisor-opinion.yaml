experiment_id: DOJO-EXP-0001
advisor:
  provider: self
  model: current-thread
recommendation: approve
risk_level: low
reasoning: I built this to solve a real problem I hit while adding Dojo tools to server.ts.
  The code is read-only, well-structured, and ran successfully. Regex parsing is appropriate
  for this static analysis use case. Permissions are correctly scoped to read-only
  plus results output.
concerns:
- Regex may miss edge cases like template literals or dynamically constructed tool
  names, but these patterns don't exist in the current codebase
suggestions:
- Add --verbose flag for debugging regex matches
- Future iteration could validate input schema consistency between definition and
  handler

Record a design decision for the current project.

## Instructions

1. If area and summary weren't provided as arguments, ask for:
   - **area** — domain of the decision (e.g., "UI", "color", "typography")
   - **summary** — brief description of the decision

2. Optionally gather:
   - **details** — fuller explanation of rationale

3. Use the `designer_record_design_decision` tool with these values.

4. Confirm by showing where the decision was saved.

reason_code: initial_creation
summary: "Logged friction: When a decibel tool returns PROJECT_NOT_FOUND, Claude's instinct is to work around it by pushing raw files directly to GitHub that mimic the tool output structure. This defeats provenance tracking, schema consistency, and the whole point of the decibel system. Root cause: no graceful path from \"project doesn't exist\" to \"project ready\" - the right path has friction while the wrong path (raw file writes) is easy."

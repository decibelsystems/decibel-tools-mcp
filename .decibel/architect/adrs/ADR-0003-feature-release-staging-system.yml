context: We need a way to manage feature maturity and communicate stability to users. As Decibel Tools grows, some features are experimental (AI-proposed experiments in sandbox), some are working but unstable, and some are ready for production. Without clear staging, users may rely on APIs that will break.
decision: |-
  Implement a four-stage release system tracked in RELEASES.yaml:

  1. **dojo**: Experimental, AI-proposed features. Sandbox-only execution. APIs not stable.
  2. **alpha**: Working implementation but API may change between releases. Use with caution.
  3. **beta**: Stable API, gathering user feedback. Breaking changes only with deprecation notice.
  4. **release**: Production-ready. Semantic versioning applies.

  Each tool and individual feature gets a stage tag. Tools can have features at different stages (e.g., sentinel is beta but sentinel_scanData might be alpha).
consequences: |-
  Positive:
  - Clear communication of feature stability
  - Users can make informed decisions about which features to depend on
  - Provides a graduation path for experimental features
  - Enables separate beta repository for early feedback

  Negative:
  - Overhead of maintaining RELEASES.yaml
  - Need to enforce stage checks in tooling
  - May slow down feature shipping if stages are too rigid

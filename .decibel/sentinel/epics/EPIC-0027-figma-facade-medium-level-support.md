# Figma Facade — Medium-Level Support

## Summary

Dedicated figma facade with 6-8 actions for comprehensive Figma integration. Builds on existing designer tools (sync_tokens, review_figma, check_parity) and adds component browsing, export formats, and visual inspection capabilities.

## Outcomes

- Token sync (exists — designer sync_tokens)
- Review component (exists — designer review_figma)
- Check parity (exists — designer check_parity)
- List components — browse file structure and component inventory
- Get component for dev — fetch component details with layout/style specs for handoff
- Export tokens in multiple formats (CSS custom properties, Tailwind config, JSON)
- Screenshot component — render component to PNG for visual comparison
- File structure overview — map Figma pages and top-level frames

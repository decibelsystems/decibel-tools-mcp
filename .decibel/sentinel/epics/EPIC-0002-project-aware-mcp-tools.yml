status: in_progress

summary: Add projectId-based tools that resolve project roots and manage project-specific data in .decibel directories
motivation:
  - Current tools operate on global data or require explicit paths
  - Need a clean abstraction for multi-project support
  - Sentinel, Architect, and other tools should work with project context
outcomes:
  - projectPaths module resolves projectId to filesystem root
  - sentinel.listIssues and sentinel.createIssue manage YAML issues per project
  - architect.createAdr creates project-scoped ADRs
  - sentinel.scanData shells out to Python inspector with project context
acceptance_criteria:
  - resolveProjectRoot(projectId) returns ProjectConfig with root path
  - Issue files written to <projectRoot>/.decibel/sentinel/issues/*.yml
  - ADR files written to <projectRoot>/.decibel/architect/adrs/*.yml
  - Auto-incrementing IDs (ISS-NNNN, ADR-NNNN) work correctly
  - All new tools have unit tests with mocked projectPaths

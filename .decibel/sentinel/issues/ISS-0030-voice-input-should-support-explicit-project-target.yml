  Currently voice commands route to the default project (decibel-tools-mcp). Users moving between projects can easily send bugs/wishes to the wrong project.

  **Enhancement:**
  - Mobile app should send current project context with voice commands
  - Voice inbox should support `project_id` parameter
  - Consider "for senken" / "for studio" suffix parsing in transcripts
  - Show project name in confirmation UI

  **Current behavior:** All voice → decibel-tools-mcp
  **Desired:** Voice → project user is currently working on (or explicit target)

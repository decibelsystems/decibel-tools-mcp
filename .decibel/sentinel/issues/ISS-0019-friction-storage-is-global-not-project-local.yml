  friction_log writes to global decibel-mcp-data folder, not project-local .decibel/ folder like other tools.

  This breaks the "portable project intelligence" principle - friction should travel with the project.

  Path used: /Volumes/Ashitaka/Documents/GitHub/decibel-mcp-data/friction/
  Expected: {project}/.decibel/friction/

  All storage should be project-local for consistency with ADRs, issues, epics, learnings, etc.

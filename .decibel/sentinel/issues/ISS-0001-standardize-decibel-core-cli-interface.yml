  Define and standardize the CLI interface for all Decibel tools so the Node MCP shim has a consistent contract to call.

  Requirements:
  - Each tool category (sentinel, oracle, architect, designer, friction, learnings) has a top-level CLI entry point
  - Consistent argument patterns: `decibel <category> <command> [--project <id>] [--json]`
  - All commands support `--json` flag for structured output (Node shim will parse this)
  - Exit codes follow convention: 0=success, 1=error, 2=validation failure
  - Errors written to stderr, results to stdout
  - Document the full CLI surface in a single reference

  This is the foundation that makes the Node shim thin and maintainable.

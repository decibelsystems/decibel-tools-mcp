description: Add package health checks to sentinel_scan and sentinel_scanData tools. Detect outdated, vulnerable, or problematic dependencies from package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, etc. Promoted from WISH-0004.

## Resolution

Implemented package health scanning in sentinel scan. Added support for npm (package.json), Python (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml), Rust (Cargo.toml), and Go (go.mod) package manifests.

  Event payloads are currently untyped (Record<string, any>). Should have specific schemas per event type:

  - prompt_received: { prompt: string }
  - command_ran: { tool: string, result: 'success'|'error', summary: string }
  - file_touched: { path: string, action: 'read'|'write'|'delete' }
  - etc.

  Enables validation and better tooling.

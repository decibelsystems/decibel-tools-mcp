  ## Problem

  When `sentinel_log_epic` (and likely other sentinel tools) can't resolve a project ID, it silently falls back to writing to `decibel-mcp-data/sentinel/unknown_project/` instead of failing with a clear error.

  This causes:
  - Orphaned data in the deprecated `decibel-mcp-data` repo
  - User doesn't know their data went to the wrong place
  - Data doesn't show up when querying the intended project

  **Evidence:** EPIC-0010 and EPIC-0011 were written to `decibel-mcp-data/sentinel/unknown_project/epics/` instead of their intended projects.

  ## Expected Behavior

  If project resolution fails:
  1. Return clear error: "Project 'foo' not found in registry. Run `decibel registry list` to see available projects."
  2. Do NOT fall back to any default location
  3. Optionally: fall back to `decibel-tools-mcp/.decibel/` as last resort (not `decibel-mcp-data`)

  ## Fix

  1. Remove all references to `decibel-mcp-data` path
  2. Change fallback behavior to error instead of silent write
  3. If a fallback is needed, use `decibel-tools-mcp/.decibel/` 

  ## Files to Check

  - Sentinel tool implementations (log_epic, create_issue, etc.)
  - Project resolution logic
  - Any hardcoded paths to `decibel-mcp-data`

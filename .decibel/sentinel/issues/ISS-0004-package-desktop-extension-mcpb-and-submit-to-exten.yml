description: |-
  Package the Node MCP shim as a Desktop Extension (.mcpb) for one-click installation.

  Manifest requirements:
  - user_config for workspace_directory (type: directory, multiple: true)
  - user_config for any API keys (OpenAI for Oracle synthesis)
  - Declare all tools with descriptions
  - Platform-specific paths if needed (darwin vs win32)

  Challenge: Python dependency
  - Desktop Extension can't assume Python is installed
  - Options to investigate:
    1. Require Python as prerequisite (document clearly)
    2. Bundle pyinstaller-frozen binary
    3. Bundle embedded Python (large, complex)

  Recommend option 1 for v1 with clear docs, revisit binary packaging later.

  Deliverable: Submit to Anthropic Extension Directory for review.

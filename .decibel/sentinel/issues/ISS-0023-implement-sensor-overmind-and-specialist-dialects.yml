description: "Implement src/agentic/dialects/sensor.ts, overmind.ts, and specialist.ts. Each extends BaseDialect with role-specific rendering and lint rules. Sensor: terse KEY=VALUE, NEXT always present, max 1 emoji. Overmind: DECISION/GUARDRAILS/DISSENT required, no hype under YELLOW/RED. Specialist: NO EMOJI ever, begins with verdict, OPPOSE requires kill_switch. See AGENTIC_PACK_V1_DIRECTIVE.md sections 1.5-1.7."

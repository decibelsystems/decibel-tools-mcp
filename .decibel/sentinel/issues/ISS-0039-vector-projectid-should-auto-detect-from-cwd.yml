  When projectId is not specified, Vector tools should default to detecting the project from the current working directory (basename of $PWD if it contains .decibel/).

  Current behavior: Requires explicit projectId parameter.
  Expected: Auto-detect like other tools do.

## Resolution

Already implemented. resolveProjectPaths() calls getDefaultProject() which has 4 strategies including cwd discovery via findDecibelDir(process.cwd()). Verified working - vector_list_runs without projectId returns successfully.

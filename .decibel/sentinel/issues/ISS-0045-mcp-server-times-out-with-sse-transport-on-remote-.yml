  **Problem:**
  The MCP server consistently times out when using Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport for remote connections. This appears to be a recurring issue that blocks remote usage.

  **Frequency:** Every time attempting remote connection
  **Transport:** SSE (Server-Sent Events)
  **Context:** Remote connections specifically affected

  **Next Steps:**
  1. Investigate SSE connection lifecycle and timeout settings
  2. Check if this is specific to certain network configurations
  3. Consider if WebSocket transport works as alternative
  4. Look into MCP server SSE implementation for timeout handling

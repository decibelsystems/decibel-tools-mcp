  ## Directive: Fix Critical MCP Tools Issues

  ### Context
  The decibel-tools-mcp project has operational issues preventing Claude from effectively using the modular tools. This is causing friction where Claude bypasses decibel tools when projects aren't found.

  ### Issues to Address

  **1. HTTP Server Not Exposing Modular Tools**
  - Deck and studio tools are not being properly exposed through the HTTP server
  - This prevents external access to these modular components
  - Need to investigate routing and module registration

  **2. Login Bug**
  - Authentication/login functionality is broken
  - This may be blocking access to tools that require authentication
  - Could be related to session management or credential validation

  **3. Project Discovery Friction**
  - When projects aren't found, Claude bypasses decibel tools entirely
  - Should implement graceful fallbacks or better error handling
  - Consider improving project resolution logic

  ### Technical Investigation Required
  - [ ] Audit HTTP server routing configuration
  - [ ] Check modular tool registration and initialization
  - [ ] Debug authentication flow and session management
  - [ ] Review project discovery and resolution logic
  - [ ] Test end-to-end tool access from Claude

  ### Success Criteria
  - [ ] Deck and studio tools accessible via HTTP server
  - [ ] Login functionality working correctly  
  - [ ] Claude can consistently access decibel tools
  - [ ] Graceful handling when projects aren't immediately found
  - [ ] All MCP tools properly exposed and functional

  ### Priority: High
  These issues are blocking effective use of the toolchain and creating workflow friction.

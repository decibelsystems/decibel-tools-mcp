  Add Timeline as a first-class derived object from roadmap data. Provides temporal visualization and progress tracking for milestones/epics.

  Core tools needed:
  - `roadmap_timeline(projectId, view?, range?)` - query timeline entries
  - `roadmap_timeline_viz(projectId, format?)` - render ASCII/markdown/mermaid

  Timeline is read-only, derived from existing roadmap.yaml + epic status. Will need Rich for proper terminal rendering.

  See CC thread spec for full details.

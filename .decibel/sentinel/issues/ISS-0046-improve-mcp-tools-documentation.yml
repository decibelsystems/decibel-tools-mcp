  The current MCP tools documentation needs improvement to help consumers (like decibel-agent) understand how to integrate and direct tool usage effectively. Areas to cover:

  - Tool catalog with descriptions, parameters, and example usage
  - Integration guide for connecting via stdio/HTTP
  - Auto-injected parameters (e.g. projectId) and how they work
  - Taxonomy decision tree (when to use which tool)
  - System prompt snippets for directing agents to use the right tools

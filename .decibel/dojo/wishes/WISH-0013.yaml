capability: Figma design token sync and parity checking for the designer facade
reason: "Designer module tracks design decisions in YAML but has no connection
  to Figma as source of truth. Two targeted integrations: (1)
  designer_sync_tokens pulls Figma variables into .decibel/designer/tokens/ as
  YAML, (2) designer_check_parity compares recorded design decisions against the
  actual Figma file. Lightweight approach — uses Figma REST API with Personal
  Access Token, no Desktop Bridge needed. Inspired by figma-console-mcp but
  scoped to just the two high-value operations instead of replicating 56 tools."
inputs:
  - figma_file_key
  - figma_access_token
  - project_id
outputs:
  sync_tokens: Design tokens written to .decibel/designer/tokens/ as YAML,
    organized by collection/mode
  check_parity: Diff report showing design decisions that diverge from current Figma state

capability: Vintage Magic frame detection with shadow-aware OCR correction
reason: White text with black drop shadow on vintage cards (pre-8th Edition)
  causes consistent OCR errors. Detecting frame style and applying shadow-aware
  fuzzy matching would dramatically improve recognition accuracy.
inputs:
  - cvPixelBuffer (card image)
  - ocrText (raw OCR result)
  - frameAnalysis (existing frame detection)
outputs:
  isVintageFrame: bool
  correctedName: String?
  candidates: "[{name: String, confidence: Double}]"
  shadowConfusions: "{original: String, likely: String}[]"

algorithm_outline: "1. Detect vintage frame: Check for specific color signature
  in title bar region (gold/brown frame with black shadow on white text)\\n2. If
  vintage, apply shadow confusion matrix before Levenshtein: common
  substitutions like a↔r, e↔u, G↔s, n↔r\\n3. Constrain search to cards printed
  before 8th Edition (~7,500 unique names vs 30,000+)\\n4. Use multiple OCR
  candidates weighted by shadow-confusion likelihood"

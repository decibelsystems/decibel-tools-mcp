capability: Dependency & API health scanner for sentinel_scan
reason: Projects drift out of date silently - outdated SPM packages, deprecated
  API endpoints, version mismatches. Catching this in the same scan that finds
  orphans/stale items creates a unified health picture. Agents could proactively
  flag "hey, Scryfall API v2 is deprecated" before it breaks.
inputs:
  - Package.resolved (SPM lockfile)
  - api_endpoints.yaml (optional config of external APIs to monitor)
  - version_cache.yaml (last known good versions)
outputs:
  outdated_dependencies:
    - name: Alamofire
      current: 5.6.0
      latest: 5.8.1
      severity: minor
  api_drift:
    - endpoint: scryfall
      issue: v1 deprecated
      severity: high
  summary:
    total_issues: 2

algorithm_outline: 1. Parse Package.resolved for current versions. 2. Query
  GitHub releases API or Swift Package Index for latest. 3. Compare semver,
  classify severity (patch/minor/major). 4. For APIs, check configured endpoints
  against version_cache or live ping. 5. Detect deprecation headers (Sunset,
  X-API-Deprecated). 6. Aggregate into scan output under new 'outdated' flag
  category.

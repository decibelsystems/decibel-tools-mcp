title: Feedback Tool for Decibel Tools
problem: No built-in way to collect user/AI feedback on tools and workflows,
  making it hard to know what's useful and what needs improvement.
hypothesis: A lightweight feedback tool that captures thumbs up/down, tags, and
  optional context will surface patterns about tool quality, enable iterative
  improvement, and help prioritize Dojo wishlist items.

project_id: decibel-tools-mcp
target_module: tools
scope_in:
  - feedback_log tool - captures tool name, sentiment (+1/-1), optional tags and
    context
  - feedback_list tool - surfaces feedback patterns
  - Agent feedback - AI can flag when a tool result was unhelpful
  - User feedback - humans can rate tool outputs
  - Integration with Dojo wishes - link feedback to capability gaps
scope_out:
  - Complex analytics dashboard
  - Real-time feedback aggregation
  - A/B testing infrastructure
acceptance:
  - Agent can call feedback_log after tool invocations
  - feedback_list shows top complaints and praises
  - Feedback can reference specific tool calls or general workflows
  - Feedback can optionally link to a Dojo wish
risks:
  - Feedback fatigue if agents log too much
  - Storage growth if not pruned
  - Unclear signal if feedback is too sparse

title: Forecasting Engine for Capacity Planning
problem: "Engineering managers need to accurately estimate future work capacity
  and timelines. Currently there's no way to: (1) break down PRDs into
  engineer-sized tasks, (2) estimate complexity per task, (3) predict completion
  based on team velocity, (4) plan sprints/quarters with confidence."
hypothesis: By combining PRD decomposition (via LLM), complexity estimation, and
  historical velocity data, we can provide accurate capacity forecasts. The
  velocity tracking tool provides the foundation - we need to layer planning
  intelligence on top.

target_module: oracle
scope_in:
  - PRD/feature decomposition into tasks
  - Complexity estimation (t-shirt sizing or story points)
  - Time-per-worker estimates using velocity history
  - Sprint/quarter capacity planning
  - Confidence intervals on estimates
scope_out:
  - Real-time project tracking (use Sentinel)
  - Resource allocation/assignment
  - Calendar/scheduling integration
  - Budget forecasting
acceptance:
  - Can break down a PRD into 5-15 engineer tasks
  - Each task has complexity estimate
  - Uses velocity data to predict completion time
  - Provides capacity plan with confidence levels
  - Works without historical data (cold start) using heuristics
risks:
  - Estimates without historical data may be unreliable
  - PRD quality affects decomposition accuracy
  - Individual velocity varies significantly
  - Complexity estimation is inherently uncertain

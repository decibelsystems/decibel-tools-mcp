title: Decibel Agent Core - Transport-agnostic AI agent with CarbonVoice
problem: No way to interact with decibel-tools via voice/chat platforms. Current
  voice_inbox requires sync + manual processing. Users want conversational
  access from mobile, watch, messaging apps.
hypothesis: A clean core + transports architecture lets us ship CarbonVoice
  fast, add Slack/Discord/etc later, and own the memory layer (learning from
  clawdbot patterns without depending on it).

project_id: decibel-tools-mcp
target_module: tools
scope_in:
  - "New repo: decibel-agent"
  - Core orchestrator with memory/policy/tool-router interfaces
  - CarbonVoice transport adapter
  - MCP tool bridge to decibel-tools
  - Dual memory (daily log + durable facts)
  - Basic policy layer
scope_out:
  - Clawdbot fork or dependency
  - Slack/Discord transports (future)
  - Embeddings/hybrid search (v1 uses BM25)
  - Multi-tenant/team features
acceptance:
  - Gateway receives CV webhook, routes to AgentCore
  - AgentCore calls voice_command tool via MCP bridge
  - Reply sent back to CV channel
  - Daily log persisted per user
  - Policy can block tools by transport/user
risks:
  - CV API changes break transport
  - Memory search quality with BM25-only
  - Token/auth management complexity

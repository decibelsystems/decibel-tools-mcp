title: iOS Decibel Tools App
problem: Ideas happen away from the desk. Currently no way to capture wishes,
  issues, crits, or learnings on mobile. By the time you're back at a keyboard,
  the thought is gone or diluted.
hypothesis: A voice-first iOS app using SFSpeechRecognizer (same pattern as
  ios-studio) can capture thoughts instantly, parse intent locally, and sync to
  the desktop Decibel ecosystem - turning any moment into a capture opportunity.

project_id: decibel-tools-mcp
target_module: tools
scope_in:
  - Voice capture with SFSpeechRecognizer (on-device)
  - Intent parsing (reuse DOJO-EXP-0001 patterns)
  - Local Voice Inbox with Core Data/SwiftData
  - Share extension for text from other apps
  - Sync to desktop via iCloud or local network
  - "Quick actions: Wish, Issue, Crit, Learning, Friction"
  - Minimal UI - voice-first, not form-first
scope_out:
  - Full Decibel dashboard on iOS (desktop job)
  - Real-time collaboration features
  - Push notifications (v2)
  - Apple Watch app (v2)
  - Android version (separate proposal)
acceptance:
  - Can speak a wish and have it appear in desktop Decibel within 60 seconds
  - Works offline - queues locally, syncs when connected
  - Share extension captures text from Safari, Notes, etc.
  - Intent accuracy >= 85% on natural speech
  - Cold launch to recording < 2 seconds
risks:
  - Sync conflicts if editing same item on both platforms
  - "Battery drain from always-listening (mitigation: manual trigger only)"
  - App Store review for microphone usage
  - Scope creep into full mobile dashboard

title: AI-Driven Forecasting from Observed Data (replaces manual estimation)
problem: "DOJO-PROP-0007 (Forecasting Engine) has solid math — the calibration
  loop and confidence intervals are great. This proposal evolves the input model
  to lean into Decibel's strength: rather than asking humans to estimate upfront,
  the AI should derive forecasts from data already flowing through the system.
  The goal is the same (accurate timelines), but with zero added friction for
  the developer."
hypothesis: "Rich's calibration engine can be repurposed to learn from observed
  data instead of manual input. By analyzing git history, velocity snapshots,
  issue close rates, and Vector session patterns, the AI can offer forecasts
  proactively — e.g. 'this looks like a 2-week effort based on similar past
  work' — without requiring story points or estimation ceremonies."

project_id: decibel-tools-mcp
target_module: oracle
scope_in:
  - AI analyzes git history + velocity snapshots to find similar past work
  - AI correlates Vector session patterns (backtrack rate, iteration count) with
    actual effort
  - AI uses Sentinel issue close rates to estimate throughput
  - Forecasts surfaced proactively by Oracle — no human input required
  - Confidence derived from data density rather than upfront estimation
scope_out:
  - Story points or manual estimation of any kind
  - Sprint planning workflows
  - Human-facing estimation forms or decomposition prompts
  - Jira-style capacity planning rituals
  - Anything that creates work instead of observing it
acceptance:
  - AI can answer 'how long will this take?' using only existing Decibel data
  - No new human input required beyond the task description
  - Accuracy improves automatically as more work is tracked
  - Oracle surfaces forecasts proactively when relevant (e.g. new epic created)
risks:
  - Cold start — new projects have no historical data to learn from
  - Correlation between past and future work may be weak for novel tasks
  - Over-reliance on AI estimates could create false confidence
follows: DOJO-PROP-0007
insight: "Rich's forecasting math is solid — the evolution is shifting the input
  from human estimation to AI observation. Decibel already captures the data
  needed across Velocity, Vector, and Sentinel. The calibration loop from
  DOJO-PROP-0007 can power this directly."

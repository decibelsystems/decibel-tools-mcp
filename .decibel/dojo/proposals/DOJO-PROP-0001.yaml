title: Voice Input for Decibel Commands
problem: No hands-free way to interact with Decibel - adding wishes, logging
  issues, searching artifacts all require typing. Friction slows capture of
  ideas in the moment.
hypothesis: Using on-device speech-to-text (SFSpeechRecognizer pattern from
  ios-studio) + AI intent parsing, we can route voice input to the right Decibel
  action without complex command grammars

scope_in:
  - Speech-to-text transcription
  - AI intent detection (search, add_wish, log_issue, ask_oracle)
  - Voice Inbox for queued/async items
  - Integration with existing MCP tools
scope_out:
  - Custom wake words
  - Streaming responses back as audio
  - Multi-language support (start with English)
acceptance:
  - Can speak a wish and have it logged via dojo_add_wish
  - Can speak a search query and get results
  - Can queue voice notes for later processing
  - Works on macOS (iOS later)
risks:
  - Microphone permissions UX
  - Transcription accuracy for technical terms
  - Intent disambiguation edge cases

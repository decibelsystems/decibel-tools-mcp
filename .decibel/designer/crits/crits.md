## ✗ identity — 2025-12-30 [identity, philosophy, anti-enterprise, foundational]

Traditional "org" structures (hierarchies, permission matrices, admin consoles, HR-defined distribution lists) are exactly what we're trying to escape. WISH-0006 must NOT become another enterprise org chart. The goal is to REPLACE the need for Microsoft/Google, not replicate them. Need a fundamentally different mental model - maybe: people-first not org-first, trust networks not permission trees, natural relationships not imposed hierarchy, lightweight identity not heavy user management.
  > Context: Discussing prerequisites for WISH-0005 (email summaries) - realized we need people/identity but must not fall into enterprise org trap

## ✓ identity — 2025-12-30 [identity, emergent, ai-first, zero-config, lightweight]

Identity should be emergent, not configured. First time you say "email Sarah the roadmap", Decibel asks "who's Sarah? what's her email?" and remembers. No upfront org setup. AI handles disambiguation. The contact graph grows from actual use, not from filling out forms. Stay light - prototype with flat files, let AI do the heavy lifting. Zero-config identity.
  > Context: Refining WISH-0006 philosophy - rejecting enterprise model in favor of emergent, AI-assisted, lightweight approach

## ✓ philosophy — 2025-12-30 [philosophy, ai-native, leverage, anti-enterprise, foundational]

AI gives individuals superpowers. One person + AI can do what used to require departments. Decibel isn't enterprise software that needs an army to configure - it's an AI-native amplifier for individuals and small teams. Configuration becomes conversation. The tool adapts to you. This is why we don't need heavy org infrastructure - AI handles the complexity that enterprises solve with bureaucracy.
  > Context: Core philosophy - AI as leverage, replacing enterprise overhead with intelligence

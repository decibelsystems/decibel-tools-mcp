# Status - Project Health Check

Quick project health check showing git state, issues, roadmap health, friction, code quality, and recommendations.

Use the `workflow_status` tool with no arguments.

This is equivalent to asking: "What's the state of this project?"

## What You'll Get

- **Git state**: Current branch, uncommitted changes, commits ahead/behind remote
- **Issues**: Open, in-progress, and blocked counts with recent updates
- **Health**: Roadmap health scores, at-risk and behind-schedule epics
- **Friction**: Top pain points sorted by signal (how often they're encountered)
- **Code Quality**: God files count, high/medium severity issues from auditor
- **Recommendations**: Oracle's suggested next actions

## When to Use

- Start of day / beginning a work session
- Before a standup
- Quick pulse check on project health
- After being away from the project
